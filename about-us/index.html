            <div id='lisa'><h2>Lisa</h2>
                <div class='images'><img src="../assets/devs/lisa-pic.png"></div>
                <p>Lisa once had a dog that looked more like a coyote.  Now she's a plant person and would like to note that plants are easier to clean up after.  When not coding, Lisa can be found playing trumpet in big bands, talking about bike/ped infrastructure, and sharing physics demonstrations with kids young and old.

            <div id='libby'><h2>Libby</h2>
                <div class='images'><img src="../assets/devs/libby-pic.png"></div>
                <p>Libby is a designer and developer in Portland, OR. The only pet she really wants is one she doesn’t have to take out on walks. You also won’t ever see her with poop bags so this game makes her feel like a good Samaritan. She loves rollers skating, picnics, and looking at Big Pink.</p>
            </div>

            <div id='sarah'><h2>Sarah</h2>
                <div class='images'><img src="../assets/devs/sarah-pic.png"></div>
                <p>Sarah is actually a cat-person.  She prefers them to children.  She does enjoy web development in the park and does occasionally pick up random poo out of kindness.</p>
            </div>
  
            <div id='tess'><h2>Tess</h2>
                <div class='images'><img src="../assets/doggo-placeholder1.png"></div>
                <p>Tess is a dog person but not necessarily a dog park person, for reasons that this game demonstrates. When not dreaming about her childhood Boxer dog, she's coding apps like this!</p>

            <div id='acl'><img src="../assets/devs/ACL.png" alt="Achemy Code Lab"></div>

            <div id='casey'><h2>Casey</h2>
                <div class='images'><img src="../assets/devs/casey-pic.jpeg"></div>
                <p>Casey is a full stack developer with a wealth of experience in the medical field.  He has a dog and a cat and some kids and a wife and is usually the guy picking up poop left by his neighbors and/or his neighbor’s pets.</p>
