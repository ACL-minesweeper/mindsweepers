                Wow, you are such a good samaritan!
                The purpose of the game is to find all the doggy doo in the park and put it into a bag. To start, click anywhere on the board. If you step in doo before you give it a doggy bag, you lose! The numbers indicate how many adjacent boxes contain doggy doo. Be sure to mark the squares you think have doo with a doggy bag.  Click the bag then click the square that has the doo.  You can remove a bag by clicking on it if you later think you are wrong. Make sure not to run out of bags before the park is doo-free. Once all the doos are in a bag and all the other spaces are doo-free, you win!
